  This demo is based on the GD32H759I-EVAL-V2.0 board, it provides a description of 
how to use the USB_HS1_Host peripheral. After connecting the cable from USB to serial port, 
the related information can print out on the serial port assistant.

  When an USB Device is attached to the Host port, the device is enumerated and checked
whether it can support HID device or not, if the attached device is HID one, when the user
press the User key, the mouse or the keyboard application is launched.

  Moving the mouse will move the pointer in the display rectangle and if a button is pressed,
the corresponding rectangle will be highlighted in green.

  If a keyboard has been attached, the display show the following messages and the taped
characters are displayed in green on the display.

  In the USB Host HID class, two layouts are defined in the usbh_hid_keybd.h file and could 
be used (Azerty and Querty).

  //#define QWERTY_KEYBOARD
  #define AZERTY_KEYBOARD

  The User can eventually add his own layout by editing the HID_KEYBRD_Key array in the 
usbh_hid_keybd.c file.

  The demo support the functions of host suspend and wakup. The macro of USB_LOW_POWER can 
be set to 1 to test the suspend and wakeup. If you want to use the general wakeup mode, please 
press the Wakup key. If you want to use the remote wakeup mode, please operating device, such as 
move the mouse or press the keyboard. If you want the program to continue running, please press 
the Wakeup key.

    JP70 must be fit to USB.
    JP68 must be fit to USART.
